# Real-Time Online Payment Fraud Detection and Blocking System

## Problem Statement

Online payment fraud is rapidly increasing worldwide across multiple channels such as cards, net banking, UPI, and tap-to-pay. Fraudsters use sophisticated tactics including social engineering, phishing, device takeovers, and merchant manipulation to bypass existing prevention systems.

Current fraud detection solutions often fail to provide real-time protection and lack adaptive intelligence, which results in delayed or missed detections and significant financial losses.

Key Challenge:
How can we build a system that instantly detects and blocks fraudulent behavior before damage occurs?

---

## Solution Overview

We propose a real-time, intelligent fraud detection system with the following capabilities:

- *Instant Transaction Analysis:* Every transaction is analyzed in real-time.
- *Machine Learning-Based Risk Scoring:* Uses behavioral patterns, location anomalies, transaction types, and volume spikes.
- *Dynamic Flag & Verify Process:* Flags suspicious transactions for immediate user verification.
- *Automated Blocking:* Prevents transactions that fail verification or exceed risk thresholds.
- *Continuous Learning:* System adapts to emerging fraud patterns through feedback loop and retraining.
- *Multi-Channel Coverage:* Supports payments via cards, net banking, UPI, and tap-to-pay.

---

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of online transactions.
- Risk scoring based on multiple transaction attributes.
- Immediate user challenge for flagged transactions.
- Audit trails and reporting for compliance and analysis.
- Dashboard integration for analysts and stakeholders.


## Sample Code Snippet: Transaction Risk Scoring (Python)


# SecurePay Fraud Detection App

## What Our App Does – SecurePay

SecurePay is an app built to *drastically cut online fraud risk*.

Scenario: User logs in and tries to make a payment.

Transaction is routed to a secure *FTC-based backend system* for analysis by:
- Data analysts
- FTC officers
- Cybersecurity experts

---

## How Our AI Detects Fraud – Smart Transaction Check

Each transaction goes through our *machine learning model* that scans for:

1. *Unusual Payment Behavior*

2. *Drastic Shift in User Location*

3. *Sudden Rise in Payments to Risky Merchants*  
   (e.g., gambling, crypto)

4. *Spike in Transaction Volume*  
   in short time

Flags are raised automatically before fraud can occur.

---

## Flag & Verify – Stop Hackers in Real-Time

- *Flagged Transactions:* Trigger instant user verification.

- *If Not Verified:* The transaction is blocked.

- *Hacker Stopped:* Potential hacker is stopped.

This process creates a dynamic firewall around each transaction.
